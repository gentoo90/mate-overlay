After a long period of living in the mate-overlay, MATE 1.6 is
in the process of being added to Portage. However this does mean
there will be a period that MATE will be masked in the portage tree.

During the import MATE will be masked in portage and you will need
to unmask MATE that comes from the overlay. I have prepared an
example file that unmasks MATE from the overlay only [1]. Do not
unmask the any of the official ebuilds until the import is complete.
